    "## Background\n",
    "Community ecology requires an understanding of both the composition and function of species living in sympatry. Some traditional metrics, such as taxonomic richness, diversity and evenness, can help explore broad patterns in community structure across space and/or time. However, communities often consist of a large number of species that can vary in occurrence and abundance across areas or gradients of interest. While it is possible to plot and explore every single one of these species in turn, this would be extremely time-consuming, and has the added problem of not considering the communities holistically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multivariate ordination provides a way to explore patterns in both community composition and relative abundance in a diverse dataset (i.e., with 3 or more species). Such ordinations are not a statistical test, but a way of simplifying a multivariate dataset to visually explore community structure, and generate hypotheses for why such structure exists. We will use one type of ordination – Principal Components Analysis (PCA) – to examine similarities and differences in the structure of the Kioloa biological communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We understand that communities are shaped by interactions between organisms and their environment. E.g., birds eat insects, and you need high levels of insects to have lots of birds. Each of you will use your biological knowledge to formulate a prediction, visualize data testing this prediction, and run a regression model to statistically test the hypothesis."

One simple way to do that is simply dividing the number of species by the square root of the number of individuals in the sample. This particular measure of species richness is known as D, the Menhinick's index: $ D = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt(N)} $, where *s* equals the number of different species represented in your sample, and *N* equals the total number of individual organisms in your sample."
